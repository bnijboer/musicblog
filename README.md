# Music blog

This is a passion project predominantly aimed at putting my basic Node.js skills (building a CRUD system and authentication) into practice.
As I wanted to be the only admin for now, I commented out the register form and hid the login page.

Stack:
- HTML
- CSS / Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Node.js
- MongoDB

Possible functionalities to add in the future:
- Search bar
- Sort by music styles
- Jump to page numbers
- Suggested posts
- Email subscription option
